# Google AdSense Setup Guide for BriefUtils

## Current Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Couldn't verify your site" Error
This happens when Google AdSense can't find or verify your AdSense code on your website.

**Solution:**
1. Get your AdSense Publisher ID from Google AdSense dashboard
2. Set up environment variables (see step 2 below)
3. Deploy the changes to production
4. Update your ads.txt file (see step 4 below)

### Issue 2: "Only one 'enable_page_level_ads' allowed per page" Console Error
This was caused by duplicate auto ads initialization.

**Solution:** âœ… **FIXED** - Updated the auto ads initialization to prevent duplicates.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your AdSense Publisher ID
1. Go to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Navigate to **Account** â†’ **Account Information**
4. Copy your Publisher ID (format: `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables on Vercel
1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your `TinyTools` project
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
4. Add these variables:

```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_PUBLISHER_ID
Value: ca-pub-your-actual-publisher-id

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_ADS
Value: true

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AUTO_ADS
Value: true
```

### Step 3: Update ads.txt File
1. Open the file `public/ads.txt` in your project
2. Replace the example line with your actual publisher ID:
```
google.com, pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
```
3. Remove the `ca-` prefix from your publisher ID (so `ca-pub-2701468620398349` becomes `pub-2701468620398349`)
4. Uncomment the line (remove the `#` at the beginning)

### Step 4: Deploy and Verify
1. Commit and push your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update AdSense configuration"
git push
```

2. Wait for Vercel to deploy (usually 1-2 minutes)

3. Verify your ads.txt file is accessible:
   - Visit: https://briefutils.com/ads.txt
   - You should see your publisher ID listed

4. Verify AdSense script is loading:
   - Visit your website
   - Open Developer Tools â†’ Network tab
   - Look for requests to `pagead2.googlesyndication.com`

### Step 5: AdSense Site Verification
1. Go back to Google AdSense
2. In your site list, click **"Review"** next to briefutils.com
3. Google will now be able to verify your site
4. This process can take 24-48 hours
