2. Verify your email address

## 2. Create an Email Service

1. In your EmailJS dashboard, go to **Email Services**
2. Click **Add New Service**
3. Choose **Gmail** as your email service
4. Connect your Gmail account (sefridkapllani@gmail.com)
5. Note down the **Service ID** (e.g., `service_xxxxxxx`)

## 3. Create an Email Template

1. Go to **Email Templates** in your dashboard
2. Click **Create New Template**
3. Use this template content:

**Subject:** New Tool Suggestion - {{tool_name}}

**Body:**
```
New tool suggestion received from BriefUtils:

From: {{from_name}} ({{from_email}})
Tool Name: {{tool_name}}
Priority: {{priority}}

Description:
{{tool_description}}

Use Case:
{{use_case}}

---
This email was sent from the BriefUtils tool suggestion form.
```

4. Set the **To Email** to: `{{to_email}}`
5. Save the template and note down the **Template ID** (e.g., `template_xxxxxxx`)

## 4. Get Your Public Key

2. Find your **Public Key** (e.g., `user_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

## 5. Update the Contact Page

Replace the placeholders in `/src/app/contact/page.tsx`:

```typescript
await emailjs.send(
  'YOUR_SERVICE_ID',    // Replace with your Service ID
  'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID',   // Replace with your Template ID
  templateParams,
  'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'     // Replace with your Public Key
);
```

## 6. Test the Form
